# Welcome to the Repositories and Descriptions for code written by Nicole Fleming!

## Table of Contents

[Math 4610](https://github.com/nicoleefleming/math4610/blob/master/README.md)

This repository holds all the work done in USU's Fall 2020 Numerical Methods course taught by Joe Koebbe. It will be made public upon graduation from USU.
The link will redirect you to the Tasksheet table of contents for the course. There is a link in the Table of Contents that will take you to the Software Manual for the course.

[Math 5620](https://github.com/nicoleefleming/math5620/blob/master/README.md)
 
This repository holds all the work done in USU's Spring 2020 Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations course taught by Joe Koebbe. It will be made public upon graduation from USU.
The link will redirect you to the Tasksheet table of contents for the course.

[CS2420 Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/nicoleefleming/Algorithms-Data-Structures/blob/master/README.md)

This houses all the code written while taking this course at USU from Andy Brim. This course was taught in Java. There are no Software Manual pages for this repository, as the idea of the manual was introduced a few years after taking this course.

[CS3100 Operating Systems](https://github.com/nicoleefleming/CS3100-OperatingSystems/blob/master/README.md)

This houses all the code written while taking this course at USU from Erik Falor. The course had just migrated from being taught in C++ to Java. There are no Software Manual pages for this repository, as the idea of the manual was introduced a few years after taking this course.

[CS2410 JavaFX GUIs](https://github.com/nicoleefleming/CS2410-JavaFX-GUIs/blob/master/README.md)

This houses all the code written while taking this course at USU from Andy Brim. The course was taught in Java, using JavaFX. There are no Software Manual pages for this repository, as the idea of the manual was introduced a few years after taking this course.

[CS5500 Parallel Programming Project](https://github.com/nicoleefleming/ParallelProgrammingProject/blob/master/README.md)

This is the Project that I worked on in collaboration with Derek Smith at USU in Spring 2020. We did a parallelized Jacobi Matrix Solver, with intent on timing the iterations when run on multiple logical and physical cores to see where the size would impact the efficiency and where the physical limit of one laptop would impact the ability to run effieciently. 

[CS5500 Parallel Programming](https://github.com/nicoleefleming/CS5500-ParallelPrograpmming/blob/master/README.md)

This houses code written for the course. *The code is not here as of yet, but will get pushed once it is in a better format.
